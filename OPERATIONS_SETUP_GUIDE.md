## 1. Gym Management Software

**Recommendation: Use an all-in-one climbing gym platform.** Building or piecing together custom solutions is costly and time-consuming. These platforms are built specifically for climbing gyms and handle everything below.

### Top Options (Compare & Demo)

| Platform | Best For | Key Strengths |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **[Rock Gym Pro](https://www.rockgympro.com)** | Established gyms, high volume | Industry standard since 2008. 25M+ users, $2B+ transactions. Used by Movement, Triangle Rock Club. |
| **[Approach](https://www.approach.app)** | Modern UX, flexibility | Cloud-native, highly flexible. Trusted by Philadelphia Rock Gyms, Long Beach Rising. |
| **[BETA](https://www.sendmoregetbeta.com)** | New gyms, migration | Free data migration, setup & training included. Climbing-specific. |
| **[Clava](https://on-clava.com)** | International/multi-location | Multilingual, global presence. |

**Action:** Request demos from at least 2 platforms. Compare pricing, support, and how well they fit your specific offerings (day passes, memberships, classes, events, Marc's Base Camp, etc.).

## 2. Electronic Waivers

**Why:** Required for liability protection. Digital waivers are faster, searchable, and legally compliant when properly implemented.

**What your software should provide:**
- Digital waiver collection (sign on tablet, kiosk, or online before visit)
- Storage and searchability (find any waiver by name/date)
- Minor waivers (parent/guardian signature)
- Automatic linking to member profiles
- Compliance with e-signature laws (ESIGN, UETA)

**Rock Gym Pro, Approach, and BETA** all include integrated digital waivers. No need for a separate waiver service if you use one of these platforms.

**Important:** Have a lawyer review your waiver language. Waivers reduce—but don’t eliminate—liability. Pair with strong safety practices and insurance.

---

## 3. Memberships & Recurring Payments

**What you need:**
- Recurring billing (weekly, monthly, annual)
- Automatic retry on failed payments
- Proration when upgrading/downgrading
- Freeze/pause options
- Household/family plans
- Stripe or similar payment processor integration

**All major climbing gym platforms** support recurring membership billing with Stripe integration. Configure:
- Membership tiers (e.g., Basic, Unlimited, Family)
- Billing cycles
- Trial periods (if offered)
- Cancellation and refund policies

---

## 4. Point of Sale (POS)

**What you need:**
- Day passes, memberships, punch cards
- Retail (chalk, gear, snacks)
- Rental gear (shoes, harnesses)
- Classes, events, birthday parties
- Tax handling
- Receipts (email/print)
- Cash drawer support (if you accept cash)

**Built into:** Rock Gym Pro, Approach, BETA, Clava. No separate POS system required.

**Hardware:** Tablet or computer at front desk, receipt printer, barcode scanner (for retail), card reader (Stripe Terminal or similar).

---

## 5. Check-In & Visitor vs Member Tracking

**What you need:**
- Fast check-in (barcode key tags, QR codes, or name lookup)
- Clear distinction: Member (pre-paid) vs Day Pass (pay per visit)
- Visit history and analytics
- Capacity tracking (optional but useful)

**How it works in these systems:**
- **Members:** Scan key tag or look up name → system confirms active membership and waiver → check-in
- **Visitors:** Look up or create profile → verify/sign waiver → sell day pass → check-in

**Reporting:** Use built-in reports for:
- Daily/weekly visitor vs member counts
- Peak hours
- Conversion (visitor → member)
- Retention

---

## 6. Rosters & Class Management

**What you need:**
- Class/program schedules (e.g., Ladies Night, Homeschool Fridays)
- Online registration
- Rosters and attendance
- Waitlists
- Instructor assignment
- Capacity limits

**Special programs to configure:**
- **Free Friend Friday** — BOGO logic (member + first-time guest)
- **Ladies Night** — Wednesday 6–10pm, $10 with gear
- **Homeschool Fridays** — 2nd & 4th Friday, 3–6pm
- **Birthday parties, lock-ins, team building** — event booking with pricing

**All platforms** support calendars, online booking, and rosters. Set up each program as a class or event type with the right pricing and rules.
